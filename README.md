# Greedy_bot

Its a bot that focus on early agro, then tries to make a transition

TODO see replay and figure out why it loses to terran build in AI sometimes(Cheater 2 and 3)

TODO make it search for bases when starting base is already destroyed(very important)

TODO dont follow the scouting worker all the way(fixed for workers, not for lings)

TODO not keep attacking when ramp is blocked or when its an impossible fight

TODO add Broodlords(maybe)

TODO smarter queen control (No need to send all unsigned queens to unsigned bases, just 1)

TODO better micro(very important)

TODO better values / timings(will have to take advise from strong players)
